# Programming Challenges

These challenges are designed to hone your algorithmic thinking skills. To make the most out of these challenges, we have two ground rules:

1. Do not use AI tools: While AI tools like ChatGPT or Bard can provide solutions, they should not be used in these challenges. The focus here is on developing your skills, not leveraging the abilities of an AI.

2. Do not look up the answers online: Simply searching for the answers online bypasses the crucial thinking process necessary for growth.

Remember, everyone learns at their own pace, and it's okay to make mistakes. Some of the best learning moments come from understanding and fixing our errors. Without further ado, letâ€™s begin!

## Stretch Challenge: Hangman

Hangman is a popular word-guessing game. The goal of the game is to guess a secret word within a limited number of attempts. The game provides visual feedback by revealing the word's letters as they are guessed correctly and showing a hangman being drawn as the guesses become incorrect. Note, instead of progressively "drawing" the hangman, you can use a "guesses remaining" countdown.

Your task is to write a program in Python or JavaScript that allows a player to play a game of Hangman in the terminal. The user should be able to make guesses by inputting letters, and the game should track and display the progress of the game after each guess.
